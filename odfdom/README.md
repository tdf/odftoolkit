# ODFDOM Java Library

## About ODFDOM

ODFDOM is an OpenDocument Format (ODF) framework. Its purpose 
is to provide an easy common way to create, access and 
manipulate ODF files, without requiring detailed knowledge of
the ODF specification. It is designed to provide the ODF
developer community with an easy lightwork programming API
portable to any object-oriented language.

The current reference implementation is written in Java.
