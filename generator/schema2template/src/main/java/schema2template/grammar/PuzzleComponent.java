/**
 * The first purpose of this interface is to provide a kind of "piece of a puzzle" representing the
 * key definitions of a schema and their relationship:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Element PuzzlePiece
 *   <li>Attribute PuzzlePiece
 *   <li>Attribute Value PuzzlePiece
 *   <li>Attribute Datatype PuzzlePiece
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The second purpose of this interface is to hide the differences between one definition and a
 * Collection of definitions. By this you will be able to use single definitions and collections of
 * definitions as method parameters. The method getCollection() is a helper method for this.
 *
 * <p>By using this interface you declare that:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>you don't care if a PuzzleComponent is a Collection of Jigsaw pieces or one single Jigsaw
 *       piece.
 *   <li>you expect one single name. If the PuzzleComponent is a Collection of definitions, all
 *       definitions have to be equally named. Calling getQName(), toString(), getLocalName() or
 *       getNamespace() on a Collection of differently named definitions will throw a
 *       RuntimeException. For example: A multiple definition of an attribute is frequently used in
 *       an XML schema.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Unambiguously named (ns:localname) object.
 *
 * <p>Contract: Every object implementing hasQName should overwrite the toString() method and return
 * the QName.
 *
 * <p>Warning: Using this interface does not imply any information about the equals() or hashCode()
 * methods. So for using objects with qualified names in a Collection, you need information from the
 * implementing class.
