# Get Involved

You don't need to be a software developer to contribute to
the ODF Toolkit. To be successful this project
requires a range of different skills, levels of involvement and degrees of
technical expertise. So, if you want to get involved in the ODF Toolkit, there
is almost certainly a role for you.

We are looking for people to:

* provide feedback
* write or update documentation
* help new users
* recommend the project to others
* test the code and report bugs
* fix bugs
* give us feedback on required features
* write and update the software
* create artwork
* anything you can see that needs doing

All of these contributions help to keep a project active and strengthen
the community. The project team and the broader community will
therefore welcome and encourage participation, and attempt to make it
as easy as possible for people to get involved.

## Mailing lists

Your first engagement with the project should be to subscribe to our
[mailing lists][14].

## Decision Making

The most important thing about engaging with any opensource project is that everyone
is equal. All people with an opinion are entitled to express that opinion and, where
appropriate, have it considered by the community.

To some the idea of having to establish consensus in a large and distributed team
sounds inefficient and frustrating. Don't despair though, we still use the Apache Way, which has a
set of simple processes to ensure things proceed at a good pace.

As in ASF projects we don't like to vote.
Most of the time we work with the consensus building techniques documented below.

### Lazy Consensus

[Lazy consensus][12] is the first, and possibly the most important, consensus building
tool we have. Essentially lazy consensus means that you don't need to get explicit
approval to proceed, but you need to be prepared to listen if someone objects.

### Consensus Building

Sometimes lazy consensus is not appropriate. In such cases it is necessary to
make a proposal to the mailing list and discuss options. There are mechanisms
for quickly showing your support or otherwise for a proposal and
[building consensus][11] amongst the community.

Once there is a consensus people can proceed with the work under the [lazy
consensus][12] model.

### Voting

Occasionally a "feel" for consensus is not enough. Sometimes we need to
have a measurable consensus. For example, [voting][13] might be a good tool before adding a new committers or
to approve a release.
