### Major updates with this version

#### Generation & Templates

* ODFDOM source generation (generator project) was [completely refactored](https://github.com/tdf/odftoolkit/pull/182), allowing to trigger generation from the ODFDOM project (***mvn install -Dcodegen***) to generate, copy and format the Java classes of the 3 XML grammars:
    1. ODF XML manifest
    2. ODF XML digital signature
    3. ODF XML schema
* **API changes** due to former code generation issues have been addressed in [this email on the ODF dev list](https://listarchives.odftoolkit.org/dev/msg00062.html). But there is also a lot of "noise" as the the base class feature was fixed (see below). The API Changes between ODFDOM 0.10.0 and 0.11.0 are listed [here](./api/odfdom-api-changes-0.10.0-0.11.0.html).
* There are now [tests for all ODF generation examples](https://github.com/tdf/odftoolkit/tree/master/generator/schema2template/src/test/java/schema2template/grammar) ([ODFDOM Java, OdfReference and some Python alpha work](https://github.com/tdf/odftoolkit/tree/master/generator/schema2template/src/test/resources/test-reference/odf/generation)).
    Only all ODFDOM Java sources are being compared by line with the references, as others have still some variations with the numbering of multiple definitions. Likely, not all tests will be kept active to allow quick build/tests and must only be activated when generator, grammar, XML dependencies (as MSV) is being altered (or before releases).
* The history feature has been fixed. Allowing the tagging/versioning of newly inserted ODF XML nodes in the documentation. That is the reason why all ODF versions are being generated - I realized the need for previous grammar for this feature late, otherwise, the Maven plugin might allow a list of grammar. Nevertheless, the given list of generations is being ordered by module and version tag from the generator.
* The base class feature has been fixed. When a base class is defined in the generation configuration, which is required in addition to the XML grammar, all elements with the same base class will have their union attributes and child elements moved into that base class.
* Prior manual added functionality to the generated source has been moved into a [Velocity Macro file](https://github.com/tdf/odftoolkit/blob/master/generator/schema2template/src/test/resources/test-input/odf/generation/odfdom-java/dom/template/velocity-macros.vm) (to ease reading the template - likely best done with [VSCode extension for Velocity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Quidgest.vscode-velocity)) and is triggered by certain attributes (e.g. [elements with xhtml:content](https://tdf.github.io/odftoolkit/odf1.2/OpenDocument-v1.2-reference.html#attribute_xhtml:content_0) require special handling for RDF metadata) or by configuration (e.g. some elements are being duplicated by a repetition attribute, which is now being explicitly named) to allow to add the functionality for repetition and split to the XML classes.
ODF JSON Chang

#### Maven

* For Maven the dependencyManagement and pluginManagement functionality is being used more strictly to define version numbers for Maven dependencies and plugins only once in the root project.
* The signing of artifacts is no longer required for every build only for releases.
* The latest released & overworked [Multi Schema Validator (MSV)](https://github.com/xmlark/msv/) is being used. ODF element children as [GraphML](https://github.com/tdf/odftoolkit/tree/master/generator/schema2template/src/test/resources/test-reference/odf/graphml) and [MSV RunTime dumps](https://github.com/tdf/odftoolkit/tree/master/generator/schema2template/src/test/resources/test-reference/odf/msv-dump) are additional regression tests of the Toolkit's generator.

#### ODF JSON Changes (Collaboration)

* Text styles/format as part of the ODF Paragraph style (style:text-properties) are overtaken during a merge as span element as long as the paragraph. Unfortunately, only a few nodes were added to this span, as the logical length of ODF was mixed up with the length of XML nodes.
* When the prior described merge was initiated the first node (often a text node) was unnecessary split. This was fixed by adding a second end parameter when the sequence have to end. These fixes lead to several positive side effects and updates of the JSON references.

## Release 0.10.0

[ODFDOM 0.10.0](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/odftoolkit/odfdom-java/0.10.0/) is released on November 26th, 2021. Git tag: "odftoolkit-0.10.0". Major updates are coming with this version:

* JDK 11 (or higher) is required to build
* **Collaboration API**: No developer would ever sent a zipped repository for exchanging work with other developers. Still we are doing this by zipping document and sending those. To be able to dispatch only changes among collaborators new functionality had bee added: Any OpenDocument Text can now be transformed into an equal sequence of user changes ([ODT](./docs/presentations/character-styles.odt)/[JSON](./docs/presentations/character-styles.json)).
 This list of user changes is like a batch of text operations, similar as if the user would created the document from top to the bottom. Foremost, new user changes can be merged into the existing document via JSON.
 For more details see the [list of supported changes/operations](./odfdom/operations/operations.html)
* Many Fixes & enhancements, which were done over several years by merging (more an overwriting) with the former Open-XChange ODFDOM fork.

### GitHub issues fixed in this release 0.10.0

* #61 Validating encrypted files
* #70 ODFDOM should support XML default namespace
* #78 Make odfdom-java an OSGi bundle
* #112 ODFValidator & Exit Code
* #116 Broken links in ODF TOOLKIT RELEASE NOTES

## Release 0.9.0

[ODFDOM 0.9.0](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/odftoolkit/odfdom-java/0.9.0) is released on November 26th, 2021. Git tag: "odftoolkit-0.9.0".

* JDK 8 is required to build
* First release of the ODF Toolkit at The Document Foundation (TDF)
* All modules of the ODF Toolkit now have unified version numbers following ODFDOM's current version number
* Last release bundling the Simple API, which includes too many copied source code, likely as it was meant as a stand-alone fork. The Simple API is by copying and obfuscating ODFDOM API incompatible with the upcoming Collaboration API and is being removed (see above).
* validator supports ODF 1.3
* validator can now validate manifest of encrypted ODF files as produced by LibreOffice
* Many fixes & enhancements
* Another [anomaly in the generator was fixed](https://github.com/tdf/odftoolkit/commit/8256ac43df9559890c6c7d68808383129124cd0a).
