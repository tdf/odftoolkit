### Requirements Tracking

Below are requirements from our users.

### Requirements for table (2010.12.20)

- getRowList/getColumnList, if there is a row element with 65535 repeate number, then get row list will return a list which contains 65535 row element, it is not necessary and time consuming.
- memory leak, because of using static map variables (Recorded in bugzilla, 2010.12.21)
- use SAX API to get the content/style element as required, rather than load whole dom tree to memory, which might cause out of memory exception if many large document has been loaded in the same time.
- create row/column/cell with/without repeat number(for example,if i want to create 10 rows, how to implement it ? with 10 row element or 1 row element with 10 repeate number)
- append row/column with/without previous row/column style, there should be a flag for setting it.
- cell format type can be auto calculated according to the style of cell.

#### Requirements for section and text box (2010.12.20)

- repeating sections of data. Repeating section may be to clone a section of a template multiple times for different data. So identify an element(s) in the document and be able to clone it and add it into the document. Think like a block of text in a document (maybe a table or a paragraph) that we grab, copy, repeat x times, and then modify a bookmark inside each section.
- text boxes that get a name at design time and something we can call it programmatically and then do something with it (delete, modify, etc.)
- embedded text tagging with multiple levels - tag a paragraph and then tag a section of text within it - so we can turn stuff off, do repeats, and do repeats within the sections.
