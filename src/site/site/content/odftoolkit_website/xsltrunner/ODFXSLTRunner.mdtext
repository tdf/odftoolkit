# ODF XSLT Runner

## Simplify the application of XSLT stylesheets to ODF documents

**ODF XSLT Runner** is a small Java application that allows you to apply
XSLT stylesheets to XML streams included in ODF packages without extracting
them from the package. It can be used from the command line. A [driver][1] to use
it within Ant buildfiles is also available.

## Getting and building ODF XSLT Runner

**ODF XSLT Runner** is build by a NetBeans project. After you have checked out
the sources from the Mercurial repository, you can open the project
in NetBeans and build **odfxsltrunner**.

A binary release of **odfxsltrunner.jar** is available in the ODF Toolkit binary package. Please download [here][3].
If you need the earlier single jars, please access [here][2].

Building and running **odfxsltrunner.jar** requires additional jar files.
Please see Requirements for details.

## Examples

Example stylesheets can be found on the [ODFXSLTRunner Examples][8] page.

## Command Line Options

**ODF XSLT Runner** is called by one of the below command lines:

```shell
java -jar odfxsltrunner.jar <style sheet> [-v] [-f <factory>] [-p <path in package>]
     [-l log file] <input package> [<output package> [name=value ...]

java -jar odfxsltrunner.jar <style sheet> [-v] [-f <factory>] [-p <path in package>]
     [-l log file] -t <input package> <output package> [name=value ...]

java -jar odfxsltrunner.jar <style sheet> [-v] [-f <factory>] [-p <path in package>]
     [-l log file] -r <package> [name=value ...]

java -jar odfxsltrunner.jar <style sheet>; [-v] [-f <factory>] [-p <path in package>]
     [-l log file] [-x <extract path> ...] -o <input package> <output file> [name=value ...]

java -jar odfxsltrunner.jar <style sheet> [-v] [-f <factory>] [-p <path in package>]
     [-l log file] -i <input file> <output package> [name=value ...]
```

The default is to apply the XSLT stylesheet **&lt;style-sheet&gt;** to the stream
**content.xml** of the ODF file **&lt;input package&gt;**.
If no **&lt;output package&gt;** parameter is specified, then the result of the transformation will be printed to the standard output. If an **&lt;output package&gt;** is specified, the **&lt;input package&gt;** is copied to the **&lt;output package&gt;**, and the steam **content.xml** of the **&lt;output package&gt;** is replaced with the result of the transformation.

The **-p** option allows to specify another stream in the package as source of the transformation than **content.xml**.

The **-t** options allows to specify a template for the output package. If it is used, the result of the transformation is stored in the **content.xml** stream (or the stream specified by the **-p** option) of the **&lt;output package&gt;**, but other streams of **&lt;output package&gt;** than that are not modified. This option can be used together with the **-i** option to create an ODF file from a plain XML file.

The **-i** option allows to specify a plain XML file **&lt;input file&gt;** as source of the transformation.

If the **-o** option is specified, the result of the transformation is stored in the plain **&lt;output file&gt;** rather than in a ODF package. This is for instance of interest if the result of the transformation is HTML. The **-x** option can be used to extract further files from the input package. A file or directory specified by this option is extracted from the package into the directory of the output file. The **-x** option can be specified multiple times.

The **-r** option allows to modify the **content.xml** stream (or the stream specified by the **-p** option) in place. If it is specified, the result of the transformation just replaces the stream that was the source of the transformation. This option should be used with care, because it modifies the original input ODF file.

The **-v** option enables a verbose mode.

The **-f** option specifies the ''javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory'' to use.

**Note:** When calling ''java'' with the ''-jar'' option, the user class path is ignored. If a transformer factory is used which is not contained in the JRE, like Saxon, **odfxsltrunner** has to be called without the ''-jar'' option:

```shell
java -cp odfxsltrunner.jar:<factory jar> org.odftoolkit.odfxsltrunner.Main ...
```

The **-l** option can be used to redirect diagnostic messages into a log file.
By default they are printed on standard error.

XSLT [Parameters][4] can be passed to the transformation by specifying them as name=value pairs. They must appear behind all other command line parameters.

## URI resolution/document() function

If the source of a transformation is an ODF package, the XSLT
[document][5] function can be used to access other files in the package than
the one that is the source of the transformation. To do so, the first parameter
of the *document()* function must be a relative URI that references the file
that shall be accessed. The reference must be relative to the source file.
The second parameter of the *document()* function must be a node within the
source file.

**Note:** The second parameter specifies the base URI for the resolution of the
URI that is specified by the first parameter. This base URI is the base URI of
the file that contains the node that is passed as second parameter. If the
second parameter is omitted, the base URI is the one of the XSLT stylesheet
containing the *document()* function itself. **odfxsltrunner** runner uses
the rules ODF defines for resolving relative URIs only for URIs that are
relative to a file within an ODF package.

**Example:** When transforming a content.xml file contained in an ODF package, the following rule applies templates to the style elements contained in the style.xml file:

```xml
<xsl:apply-templates select="document('styles.xml',.)//office:styles/style:style"/>
```

## Requirements

**ODF XSLT Runner** requires [Java RE 5][6], or a later version of Java.

It further requires ODFDOM. This former NetBeans project is pre-configured to build
ODFDOM while building **ODF XSLT Runner**. This requires that the ODFDOM
sources are located in a folder **odfdom** next to the folder of the
**ODF XSLT Runner** project.

Alternatively, the reference to the ODFDOM project in the compile time
classpath of the **ODF XSLT Runner** project may be replaced with a reference
to an already compiled **odfdom.jar**.

At run time, the **odfdom.jar** file must be either located in folder called **lib** next to the **odfxsltrunner.jar** file, or it must be in the classpath.

**Note:** ODFDOM requires [Apache Xerces] [7]. The jar file **xercesImpl.jar**
also must exist in a folder **lib** next to **odfxsltrunner.jar** file, or it
must be in the classpath. The **ODF XSLT Runner** NetBeans projects includes a
reference to **xersesImpl.jar** in the runtime classpath which has to be
adapted after checking out the project.
