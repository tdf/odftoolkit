<p>Legal policy and interpretation changes from time to time so it is worth investing a little time reading again the legal release material.</p>
<ol>
<li>Check that dependencies (and in particular those dependencies that ship in the packages) comply with Apache policy. Apache projects may distribute artifacts and documents as part of a release which are not Apache Licensed. All such artifacts must comply with <a href="http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html">Apache's 3rd party licensing policy</a>.
    All the licenses on all the files to be included within a package should be included in the LICENSE document.</li>
<li>The NOTICE document is for additional copyright and attribution statements those licenses may require. A typical NOTICE document at a minimum includes a copyright and attribution statement for The Apache Software Foundation. Nothing else belongs in the NOTICE document.</li>
<li>It is good practice to check the provenance of any source documents which do not have license headers. With the help of RAT, you can run Maven command: 'mvn verify -Ppedantic' on the "trunk" to get a report about the license header.</li>
<li>Make sure every committer have a signed <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas">Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a> on file. It's a contract between a contributor and Apache granting Apache rights to code contributed.</li>
<li>If any dependencies are cryptographic libraries then it may be necessary to fill in some <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/crypto.html">paperwork</a> to make sure they are compliance with US export regulations.</li>

<p>Documents a particular release of a product rather than the product itself. For a release manager, the first thing he should do is to consult and correct the project's release documentation. For ODF Toolkit, we should make sure the following items are ready.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure the CHANGES.txt is up to date.</li>
<li>The Cookbook was updated to support the new release, add new content and modify the old parts.</li>
<li>Make sure all of the demo codes work well under the new release. If necessary, write new demo to introduce the key new features in the new version.</li>
<li>Remember to update the online Javadoc to the newest version, but don't publish until the vote pass.</li>
<li>Prepare other website update content, save them as staged, but don't publish until the vote pass.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="iv-release-candidate">IV. Release Candidate<a class="headerlink" href="#iv-release-candidate" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A release candidate is a set of artifacts upon which a vote is held for a release. The actual nature of the release candidate depends on the release system adopted by a the project. For ODF Toolkit, we supply 3 type of artifacts, binary package, source package and document package. The release candidate jars are deployed to a Maven staging repository. Making release artefacts should follow the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make sure that your working copy is clean</p>
<p>Preferrably check out a clean version from https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/odf/trunk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare the release</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>mvn release:prepare
</pre></div>


<p>If you haven't set up your environment for automatic svn access you need to pass in username and password:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>mvn release:prepare -Dusername=APACHE_ID -Dpassword=PASSWORD
</pre></div>


<p>This will start the interactive release preparation. You need to supply Maven with the versions of the release. "release version" should be the version of the intended release (recommended value should be fine). "SCM release tag or label" should include the RC version (e.g. odftoolkit-0.6.1-incubating-RC3). "new development version" should be the current SNAPSHOT version (don't use the recommended version, e.g. when building 0.6.1-incubating this should be 0.6.1-incubating-SNAPSHOT, not 0.6.2-incubating-SNAPSHOT).</p>
<p>This will update the versions of all modules and create an svn tag. The version should always include incubating (or incubator) to ensure that the artifacts created comply with <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/incubation/Incubation_Policy.html#Releases">Incubator release policy</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform the release</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>mvn release:perform
</pre></div>


<p>This will checkout the tag to the target directory, build and package everything and upload the artifacts to the staging repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close the staging repo.</p>
<p>Log in to <a href="https://repository.apache.org/index.html">the Nexus repository manager</a>, click on Staging Repositories, select the current ODFToolkit staging repo and click on close.</p>
<p>You can test the staging repository by adding a snippet like this to your Maven settings (the url to the staged repo can be obtained from the mail you got when closing the repo):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>    <span class="nt">&lt;profile&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;id&gt;</span>odfstage<span class="nt">&lt;/id&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;activation&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;activeByDefault&gt;</span>true<span class="nt">&lt;/activeByDefault&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;/activation&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;repositories&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;repository&gt;</span>
                <span class="nt">&lt;id&gt;</span>staged-releases<span class="nt">&lt;/id&gt;</span>
                <span class="nt">&lt;url&gt;</span>https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapacheodftoolkit-127/<span class="nt">&lt;/url&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;/repository&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;/repositories&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/profile&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


</li>
<li>
<p>Package download artifacts</p>
<p>Switch to the checkout directory that has been created by the release: cd target/checkout. Use the following command to package (replace &lt;YOUR APACHEID&gt; with your apache id, e.g. devinhan):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>mvn install -Prelease-distribution -pl=. -Duser.name=&amp;lt;YOUR APACHEID&amp;gt;
</pre></div>


<p>After package there should be a folder release/$TAG in the "target\"</p>
<p>vote.txt is a draft of the dev vote mail. Each package has its own .asc, .md5 and .sha files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upload artifacts for vote.
    Login people.apache.org using your Apache LDAP account. Copy the folder release/$TAG to directory "/public_html/odftoolkit-release/$TAG" using <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/user-ssh.html">scp</a>. If the directory does't exist, please create. It is best to scp into the home directory and then copy into position from there.
    Make sure all of the files are owned by the incubator group, group readable and writable, and read only for the world. In short -rw-rw-r--. To do this from the top level:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>  &gt; find . -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;
  &gt; find . -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;
  &gt; chgrp -R incubator *
</pre></div>


<p>Then the artifacts can be accessed from Web browser. The link looks like:</p>
<p>http://people.apache.org/~$USER/odftoolkit-release/$TAG</p>
<p>Replace $USER with your Apache ID, such as "devinhan".</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="v-incubator-release-vote">V. Incubator Release Vote<a class="headerlink" href="#v-incubator-release-vote" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>After release candidate is uploaded, the release manager can start vote process. All releases by podlings must be approved by the Incubator PMC. The conventional process is for the podling to follow the usual Apache process release vote and then call for a Incubator PMC VOTE on the general incubator list.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Vote in ODF Toolkit Development List
A formal vote on candidate artifacts must be conducted by the release manager on the ODF Toolkit development list. The vote mail can be drafted based on the vote.txt, which is generated with artifacts. A sample looks like this:</p>

<p>Vote in General Incubator List
In the case of the incubator, the IPMC must approve all releases. That means there is an additional bit of voting that the release manager must now oversee on general@incubator in order to gain that approval. The release manager must inform general@incubator that the vote has passed on the project's development list, and should indicate any IPMC votes gained during that process. A new vote on the release candidate artifacts must now be held on general@incubator to seek majority consensus from the IPMC. Previous IPMC votes issued on the project's development list count towards that goal. The sample mail is:</p>
<p>Subject: [VOTE] Release Apache ODF Toolkit 0.5-incubating(RC7)
       To: general@incubator.apache.org
       Cc: odf-dev@incubator.apache.org

<ol>
<li>
<p>Distributing Releases
   The distribution upload location (www.apache.org/dist) for all Apache projects is the /www/www.apache.org/dist directory on people.apache.org. Each project (including the Incubator) owns a directory within dist.
   The directory of ODF Toolkit is http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/odftoolkit/. The release manager should move the release artifacts from /public_html/odftoolkit-release/$TAG to this directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mirroring
   To avoid excessive use of bandwidth and to increase download speeds, official releases are made available through a global network of volunteer mirrors. Using these mirrors has some notable differences from unmirrored downloads. In particular, a &lt;a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/release-download-pages.html" script&lt;/a  must be used to direct the download to an appropriate URL. The mdtext format sample is:</p>
<p>**Current Version (0.5-incubating)**
 * Source:
 * [odftoolkit-0.5-incubating-src.tar.gz](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/incubator/odftoolkit/sources/odftoolkit-0.5-incubating-src.tar.gz)
   [[asc](http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/odftoolkit/sources/odftoolkit-0.5-incubating-src.tar.gz.asc)]
   [[md5](http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/odftoolkit/sources/odftoolkit-0.5-incubating-src.tar.gz.md5)]
   [[sha](http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/odftoolkit/sources/odftoolkit-0.5-incubating-src.tar.gz.sha)]</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Users will download the mirrored release artifacts from machines outside Apache control. Users need to verify that the copy downloaded is identical to the original. Mirrored copies of checksums, KEYS and signature files (.asc and .md5 files) will be present on the mirrors but must never be used for verification. So, all links from the podling website to signatures, sums and KEYS need to refer to the original documents on www.apache.org. See release signing guide for more information.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Archiving
   All Apache releases form an important part of the history of a project. They are therefore archived with the aim of preserving them indefinitely for future reference. All artifacts within www.apache.org/dist will be automatically archived to http://archive.apache.org/dist. When a new artifact is uploaded, it will be sync'd to the archive. The sync'ing is scheduled to operate several times a day. So it may be some hours before an added artifact is archived. When an (archived) artifact is deleted from the live distribution, it will remain in the archives.
   Please remember that these archives are served from Apache bandwidth. Anyone who wants to obtain a large quantity of data from the archives should contact the Infrastructure Team.</p>

<p>Subject:[ANNOUNCEMENT] Apache ODF Toolkit(Incubating) 0.5-incubating Release
   To: odf-users@incubator.apache.org
   Hi all,</p>
<p>The Apache ODF Toolkit(Incubating) team is pleased to announce the release of 0.5-incubating. This is our first Apache release.</p>
<p>The Apache ODF Toolkit is a set of Java modules that allow programmatic creation, scanning and manipulation of Open Document Format (ISO/IEC 26300 == ODF) documents. Unlike other approaches which rely on runtime manipulation of heavy-weight editors via an automation interface, the ODF Toolkit is lightweight and ideal for server use.</p>
<p>A full list of changes is available in the change log<a href="http://incubator.apache.org/guides/releasemanagement.html">1</a>. People interested should also follow the mail list<a href="http://www.putty.org/">2</a> to track progress.</p>
<p>The ODF Toolkit source release as well as the pre-built binary deployment packages are listed in the downloads page<a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/odf/trunk/KEYS">3</a>. Pre-built versions of all ODF Toolkit components are available in the central Maven repository under Group ID "org.apache.odftoolkit" and Version "0.5-incubating".</p>
