      <h1>Simple Java API for ODF</h1> 
      <p>##What is the Simple Java API for ODF?</p> 
      <p>The Simple Java API for ODF is an easy-to-use, high-level Java API for creating, modifying and extracting data from ODF 1.2 documents. It is written in pure Java and does not require that you install any document editor on your system. The Simple Java API for ODF is a high level abstraction of the lower-level ODFDOM API.</p> 
      <p>##New Release 0.6.6</p> 
      <p>We are pleased to announce the release of the Simple Java API for ODF version 0.6.6 on Auguest 12th. The improvements in this version include:</p> 
      <ul> 
        <li>Two critical bugs in the Navigation API are fixed, as well as several other issues.</li> 
        <li>*Page columns, a page layout feature in text documents, are supported.</li> 
        <li>*Unit test coverage rate increased. This work improves the stability of our API.</li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>You can download it here. The full release notes can be found here.</p> 
      <p>ODF Toolkit has been accepted as an Apache incubator project and the move process has been started. The security features (encryption and digital signatures) will be included in Apache version. Thanks all of the contributors and users, please continue to pay attention to us in Apache.</p> 
      <p>##Project roadmap and schedule</p> 
      <p>The Simple Java API for ODF adheres to the "Release Early and Often" development philosophy. We will target a monthly release, for the end of each month. Code that is ready makes it into that month's release. Code that is not yet ready will wait.</p> 
      <p>Proposed Roadmap:</p> 
      <ul> 
        <li>Version 0.2 at the end of Oct, 2010 with the high-level methods migrated from ODFDOM and organized in new package structure;</li> 
        <li>Version 0.3 at the end of Nov, 2010 with high-level style API;</li> 
        <li>Version 0.4 at the end of Jan, 2011 with additional high-level text methods;</li> 
        <li>Version 0.5 at the end of March, 2011 with text box and fields methods;</li> 
        <li>Version 0.6 at the end of May, 2011 with chart methods;</li> 
        <li>Version 0.6.6 at the middle of August, 2011 with bugs fixed;</li> 
        <li>More work will be started in Apache.</li> 
      </ul>

      <p>###For Developers</p> 
      <p>###How to download source</p> 
      <p>First, install [http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/ latest Mercurial]</p> 
      <p>Second, setup Mercurial (optional):<br>Config file 
        <hg install dir>
          \Mercurial.ini on Windows or 
          <hg install dir>
            /.hgrc on Unix. Enhance the default configuration, using GIT diff and enable [http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/Win32TextExtension default plugin] avoid different line breaks in the source.
          </hg>
        </hg></p> 
      <div class="codehilite">

</code></pre>
      </div>  
      <p>Now, get the source code from the Simple project [http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/ Mercurial] repository. Please see below for a short introduction to using Mercurial on odftoolkit.org. There's also a more general <a href="{{project help page
SourceControl}}">help</a> on how to use source control systems on odftoolkit.org. The command <br></p>
      <div class="codehilite">
        <pre>
hg clone https://hg.odftoolkit.org/hg/simple~code-base</pre>
      </div>will download the repository into a new directory.
      <p></p> 
      <p>Please note that by this you'll get the latest changeset. If you for example want stable release 0.2, you may want to use</p> 
      <div class="codehilite">
        <pre><code>hg clone https://odftoolkit.org/hg/simple~code-base -r v0.2
</code></pre>
      </div> 
      <p>Developers however always work on the latest changeset.</p> 
      <p>####How to build and run the unit tests</p> 
      <p>After the source code is checked out, now get and install [http://maven.apache.org/ Apache Maven]. On command line test your installation with "mvn -v".</p> 
      <p>If Maven is correctly installed, change into the project directory and build with command "mvn".</p> 
      <p>##Communications</p> 
      <p>You can subscribe to the project's mailing lists from [http://odftoolkit.org/projects/simple/lists this page]. The "users" list is for discussions about using the toolkit, and the "dev" list is for discussing the development of the toolkit. Active developers should also subscribe to the "issues" and "commit" mailing lists so they will receive those automatic notifications.</p> 
      <p>##Easy entry level tasks TBD</p> 
      <p>##Design of the API</p> 
      <p>The design principle is "make it easy for users to locate the functions they want".</p> 
      <p>org.odftoolkit.simple.Document is the abstract base class which the specific document classes are derived from: TextDocument, SpreadsheetDocument, PresentationDocument, GraphicsDocument and ChartDocument.</p> 
      <p>For each document type we have a subpackage that contain additional classes related to that kind of documents. So org.odftoolkit.simple.chart has classes related to chart, org.odftoolkit.simple.text has classes related to text content, and org.odftoolkit.simple.presentation has classes related to presentation documents.</p> 
      <p>Besides the packages for different document types, there are additional packages defined for important common ODF features which are available across all kinds of documents, such as table, meta and style.</p> 
      <p>There is another package named org.odftoolkit.simple.common, which contains functions that are not related with a specific document type nor a specific feature. For example, the text extractor functions are put in this package.</p> 
      <p>##How to contribute patches</p> 
      <p>If you want to contribute a patch to this project, following below steps:</p> 
      <ul> 
        <li>Step 1. Create an issue in [http://odftoolkit.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?product=simple&amp;order=bugs.bug_id bugzilla], or write a comment to a related open issue, to describe what functions you want to provide.</li> 
        <li>Step 2. Go through "<a href="Design-of-the-API">#Design_of_the_API</a>" to make sure your contribution will follow it.</li> 
        <li>Step 3. Check out the source code following the steps in <a href="development-selection">#download_source</a>, and add your contribution codes, including the source code and the unit tests. Every public method should have a corresponding unit test method. The [http://odftoolkit.org/projects/odfdom/pages/Development#Coding_Guidelines code guidelines] are same as ODFDOM.</li> 
        <li>Step 4. Test your contribution with Mecurial command to make sure all the unit tests pass. mvn</li> 
        <li>Step 5. Generate a patch with hg commands. hg commit -A -u "Developer:xxx" -m "#bug XY# Description of changes" hg export -a -g -o ../myChanges.patch</li> 
        <li>Step 6. Upload your patch to bugzilla.</li> 
        <li>Step 7. Refactor your patch if you get comments from reviewers.</li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>##How to review patches</p> 
      <p>As a reviewer, you need to carefully read the source code, run the unit tests, to make sure the new contributed code won't hurt the quality of this project.</p> 
      <ul> 
        <li>Step 1. Write a comment to [http://odftoolkit.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?product=simple&amp;order=bugs.bug_id bugzilla], saying you would like to review this patch.</li> 
        <li>Step 2. Check out the source code following the steps in <a href="development-selection">#download_source</a>, and download the patch.</li> 
        <li>Step 3. Merge the patch to the source code with Mecurial command: hg import --no-commit ../someFile.patch</li> 
        <li>Step 4. Carefully read the code to make sure the code follows the "<a href="Design-of-the-API">#Design_of_the_API</a>", the code can reach the goal and the code won't bring other problems.</li> 
        <li>Step 5. Carefully check the unit test code to make sure every public method has been enough tested.</li> 
        <li>Step 6. Run the unit tests with Maven command to see if all the unit tests pass: mvn</li> 
        <li>Step 7. Write comment to bugzilla if you think anything needs to be improved.</li> 
        <li>Step 8. Repeat step 2 to 7 after the contributor improves the patch.</li> 
        <li>Step 9. Push the patch to repository with Mecurial command if you think the patch is good enough: hg commit -A -u "Developer:xxx Reviewer:yyy" -m "#bug XY# Description of changes" hg push https://
          <your user id>
            :
            <your password>
