    Common Public License - v 1.0

    THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON
    PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
    OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

    1. DEFINITIONS

    "Contribution" means:

    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
       documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

       i)  changes to the Program, and

       ii) additions to the Program;

       where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
       and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
       'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
       such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
       Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are
       separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the
       Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative
       works of the Program.

    "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

    "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
    or when combined with the Program.

    "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
    Agreement.

    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
    including all Contributors.

    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license
       to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
       perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
       Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
       object code form.

    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
       Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and
       otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in
       source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to
       the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time
       the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
       Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed
       Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
       which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed
       hereunder.

    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
       licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
       provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
       patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
       Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
       brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
       property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights
       and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
       responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
       needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is
       required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is
       Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
       distributing the Program.

    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
       copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
       license set forth in this Agreement.

    3. REQUIREMENTS

    A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
    under its own license agreement, provided that:

    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

    b) its license agreement:

       i)   effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
            and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
            conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties
            or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular
            purpose;

       ii)  effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
            for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
            consequential damages, such as lost profits;

       iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
            offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

       iv)  states that source code for the Program is available from such
            Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
            reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
            software exchange.

    When the Program is made available in source code form:

    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
       the Program.

    Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
    within the Program.

    Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
    Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
    Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering
    should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for
    other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program
    in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial
    Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other
    Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
    and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and
    other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
    Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
    section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual
    or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify,
    an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
    Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
    Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor
    in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified
    Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
    performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
    Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
    must pay those damages.

    5. NO WARRANTY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED
    ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
    CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR
    A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for
    determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program
    and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this
    Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program
    errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
    programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
    ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
    INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
    WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
    LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
    NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
    DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
    HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    7. GENERAL

    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
    respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
    counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
    Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of
    the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes
    patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or
    counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding
    combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes
    such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
    Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails
    to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement
    and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after
    becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under
    this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution
    of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
    obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
    relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may
    only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
    the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement
    from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right
    to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may
    assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
    separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
    distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may
    always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which
    it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is
    published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including
    its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in
    Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses
    to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,
    whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in
    the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
    intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to
    this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than
    one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights
    to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.
