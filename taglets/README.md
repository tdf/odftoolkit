# Taglets Java Library

## About Taglets

This sub project defines some Javadoc tags for ODFDOM.

The purpose is that the JavaDoc of generated Java classes representing ODF XML elements,
ODF XML attributes and types are being linked to their correct anchor in the ODF
specification (HTML).

There are three kind of taglets for ODF elements, attributes and types.

**NOTE:**
The Java Taglet API has changed from JDK 8 to JDK 9.
In JDK 8 it was using the tools.jar, since JDK 9 the existing of a tools.jar is an implementation detail and a Java API is being offered.
